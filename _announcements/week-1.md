On behalf of the entire instructional team (all 4 instructors and 18 TAs), welcome to the Spring 2022 edition of CS 4530! [This website](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2022/) will contain all of the lectures, assignments and tutorials for the class. Our [Canvas site](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/99531) contains your gradebook, as well as single-sign-on links to Piazza (for discussion), GradeScope (for submitting assignments), details of [office hours](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/99531/pages/office-hours), and replicates much of the material on the class website.

In advance of the first week of class, we've shared the [first class module](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2022/modules/week1-overview-design-principles) and the [first homework assignment](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2022/assignments/hw1). You should feel free to take a look now if you are eager, but if you are still enjoying the last moments of your winter break, then you'll be no worse off to wait to look at this material until the class begins. We are excited to meet you all next week!
