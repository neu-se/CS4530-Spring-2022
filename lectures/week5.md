### Learning Objectives:

This week's lessons will focus on testing, discussing the need for testing and importance of testing automation. We will also highlight what makes a test good or bad, how we compute code coverage and how one might judge how well a test suite accomplishes its testing goals. Finally we will discuss how to test larger systems by using test doubles.

### Important Dates:
