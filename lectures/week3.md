### Learning Objectives:
The overall theme of this weekâ€™s lessons is software engineering processes: how do we organize our (non-programming) activities so that we can build some software project as efficiently as possible? The lessons will center on these four themes:
* How do we understand what software we are supposed to build?
* How do we organize our development activities?
* How do we estimate how long a software project will take?
* How do we build an effective team?

### Important Dates:
* [Team Formation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdf7hc6AZ80f9pwAOV7vPsJxpQ-0KWy_kkIABLkP761V4UPPw/viewform?usp=sf_link)  **Due Feb 9 by 10pm**{: .label .label-red }

For more reflections on software processes in the 1980's, [David Parnas' article: "Software Aspects of Strategic Defense Systems"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs99r/readings/parnas1.pdf). For a discussion of various xDD approaches, see [Rebecca Wirfs-Brock on What Drives Design?](https://vimeo.com/7722463). [Chuck Rossi's 2014 Release Engineering Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nffzkkdq7GM) includes some great discussion of Facebook's mobile release process, [now outdated](https://research.facebook.com/publications/continuous-deployment-of-mobile-software-at-facebook-showcase/), but quite interesting; there is a discussion of team structure around 18 minutes in. [Sarah Mei's 2018 Power of Agile talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL-6RCTywbc) provides a great discussion of embracing agile values that work for your team, while leaving behind toxic practices.
