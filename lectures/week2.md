### Learning Objectives:

When you design a program or system, you will always need to express
that design in ways that can be shared with others.  The goal of this
week's lessons is to provide you with some basic vocabulary for
talking about your design.

We will talk about designs at three scales:
* The Architectural Scale, which describes the overall structure of
  your program

* The Interaction Scale, which describes the ways in which the objects
  in your program interact with each other.

* The Object Scale, which describes the structure, properties, and
  methods of individual objects.
