If you run into the error “refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow” when trying to push to GitHub, the fix is to update your saved authentication credentials for GitHub. For instance, you can follow these instructions to update your credentials in the MacOS Keychain. If all else fails, you can connect to GitHub with SSH instead of HTTPS, which will also solve this problem. This error seems to only occur when pushing a change to the GitHub Actions configuration file, so you could also side-step the problem by having a team mate push this change to GitHub instead (who may not run into this issue).

Here’s a description of the Venusian fleet: . | Each ship has a serial number, a crew, which is a list of Venusians, and a possibly-empty set of daughter ships, each of which is a ship. | Each Venusian has a name, which is a string, and a VSN (Venusian Security Number), which is a number. | When we say “fleet”, we mean a list of ships and their daughters, their daughters’ daughters, etc. | When we say the “fleet of a ship”, we mean the fleet consisting of its daughters. | . EXAMPLE: if ship 1 has daughters ship 11 and ship 12, and ship 11 has daughters 111 and 112, and ship 112 has daughters 1121 and 1122, and none of these ships has any other daughters, then the fleet of ship 1 consists of 1, 11, 12, 111, 112, 1121, and 1122 . Your task is to define TypeScript class Venusian and Ship as follows: . | The class Venusian has a contructor new Venusian(name:string) that returns a Venusian with the given name and a unique VSN. By “unique”, we mean that while your program is running, it must never re-use a VSN. It is OK for your program to re-use the same VSNs if you stop the program and run it again (it need not be a “globally unique” identifier). Venusian names are case-senstive. The class Venusian has the following public methods: . | getName():string returns the name of the Venusian. | getVsn():number returns the VSN of the given Venusian | . | The class Ship has a constructor new Ship(crew:Venusian[], daughters:Ship[]) that returns a ship with the given crew, the given daughters, and a unique serial number (similar to VSNs, the serial number need not be globally unique). The class Ship has the following public methods: . | getCrew():Venusian[] returns the crew of the ship. | getDaughters():Ship[] returns the daughters of the ship. | getSerialNumber():number returns the serial number of the ship | hasWaldo():boolean returns true iff the ship has one or more crew members named Waldo. | totalWaldos():number returns the number of Venusians named “Waldo” that are in the ship or its fleet. Venusians can be in two places at once, so if two Waldos have same VSN, you should count them twice. | removeWaldos():void removes any Venusians named “Waldo” from the crew of the ship. | removeDeepWaldos():void removes any Venusians named Waldo from the crews of the given ship and its fleet. | fleetHasDuplicates():boolean It has come to the attention of the Venusian fleet command that some shipbuilders have been cheating by putting multiple ships with the same serial number in the fleets of their ships. Given a ship, determines whether there are any duplicates among the ship and its fleet. The duplicates may occur anywhere in the ship and its fleet.` | . | . EXAMPLE: in the example above, there are no duplicates. If ship 12 were added to the daughters of ship 111, that would be a duplicate, and applying this function to ship 1 would return true. ",

When two users get close, they are able to see and hear each other through a video call. Since that original release, our lead software engineer, Avery, has been quite busy on making this app more interesting and usable. One problem that Avery observed with the app was that users would focus on exploring the relatively small map, and then not know what to do: how do you have a conversation with someone else when there is nothing to indicate that you want to talk? If two people are talking, how does a third person know that it is OK to approach them and join the conversation? . Avery has developed an exciting new feature concept for Covey.Town this semester: Conversation Areas. Avery replaced the “outdoor” map from the original Covey.Town implementation with a new map for users to explore, which has some interesting sights to see and talk about, added text chat, and designed a new conversation areas feature, highlighted in the screenshot below: . Each conversation area is a rectangle on the map. In this screenshot, there are three conversation areas: “Foyer Table 4”, “Foyer Table 5”, and “Foyer Table 6”. There are two users who are engaged in a conversation at Foyer Table 5, who have labeled the current conversation topic to be “Talking about class”.

Since this is your first time working in this codebase, Avery has sketched out a reasonable design for the Conversation Area API, and has mapped the design into implementation tasks. Avery has also provided a few sanity tests so that you can check your work. There is a complete set of tests available to you on GradeScope. This assignment does not involve any frontend development, but we will return to the frontend aspects of the Conversation Area feature in HW4. Based on past experiences, we project that this assignment could take you up to 20 hours (depending on your prior preparation). We encourage you to start early so that you can post questions on Piazza, make the most use of our TAs’ tutorials, and attend office hours as necessary in order to ensure that you can reach full marks across the board. Please note that while Part 2 looks shorter, this is mainly an artifact of us providing you with less detailed steps of what you need to do: it might take you just as long as Part 1, so do not assume that it will be a quick last few steps! . Learning Objectives . The objectives of this assignment are to: . | Read an architectural diagram and apply that design to an implementation | Expand an existing API following the coding conventions set out in an existing codebase | Translate high-level requirements into code | Become familiar with the Covey.Town codebase, which will be reused in HW3, HW4, and your final project | . You are encouraged to write tests for your implementation, however we will not grade your tests on this assignment. Grading . Your code will automatically be evaluated for linter errors and warnings. Submissions that have any linter errors will automatically receive a grade of 0. Do not wait to run the linter until the last minute. Please note that you can check for linter issues before submitting by running npm run lint; many formatting issues can also be automatically fixed by running npm run format. Each implementation task will be automatically graded by our test suite on GradeScope. You may resubmit your code an unlimited number of times for feedback. Each task is allocated a set number of points based on its complexity. There are no partial marks for passing some, but not all of the tests for a function. GradeScope will provide feedback on which checks your implementation fails. Your code will be manually evaluated for conformance to our course style guide. This manual evaluation will account for 10% of your total grade on this assignment. We will manually evaluate your code for style on the following rubric: . To receive all 10 points: . | All new names (e.g. for local variables, methods, and properties) follow the naming conventions defined in our style guide | All public properties and methods (other than getters, setters, and constructors) are documented with JSDoc-style comments that describes what the property/method does, as defined in our style guide | The code that you write generally follows the design principles discussed in week one. In particular, your design does not have duplicated code that could have been refactored into a shared method. | . We will review your code and note each violation of this rubric. We will deduct two points for each violation, up to a maximum of deducting all 10 style points. General Requirements . This is an individual assignment. Please post any questions about this assignment on Piazza. We have many sections of this class, and we want to make sure that we respond to your questions the same way, regardless of which section you are in. You may not make changes to package.json or to the lint configuration. You may not use ts-ignore or eslint-disable annotations. How To Use GradeScope’s Test Suite Effectively . We have provided a very thorough test suite on GradeScope, but our goal is for you to not rely on this test suite for debugging your code, and instead rely as an objective ground truth to determine if you have successfully implemented a task or not. You will not see detailed failure messages on GradeScope, and any console output is hidden. The names of each of the tests describe loosely what inputs the test is providing to your application, but not the detailed criteria that each test is checking for. The tests, broadly, check for the behaviors that are described in this specification. If you are struggling to understand why a test isn’t passing, we suggest a strategy called “rubber duck debugging”: Reread the specification. Read through your code line by line, thinking about and explaining what it does - as if you were explaining it to a colleague or the TA. Do NOT try to think too much about what tests you are or are not passing: think about the specification, and what you think your code does, and what it actually appears to do as you read it. ",

    "doc": "Assignment 2: Conversation Areas",
    "title": "Part 1: Base implementation of TownService’s ConversationArea API [60 points total]",
    "content": "Your first major objective for this assignment will be to create a base implementation of the ConversationArea API in the backend TownService. By the end of this part of the assignment, you will have implemented a createConversationArea API endpoint, which will create a new ConversationArea on the server, and extended the existing TownJoinHandler so that when a player joins a town and receives the initial state of the town, the list of ConversationAreas will be included in that response. Start by downloading this starter code. Extract this archive and run npm install to fetch the dependencies. Avery has provided you with some very basic sanity tests that you can extend for testing your implementation as you go. Each ConversationArea exists within a single Town in the overall Covey.Town data model. Hence, you will implement the ConversationArea API in the context of the existing service that implements the logic to manage each town. The diagram below outlines the major components in the existing TownsService. Referring to the diagram above, you’ll start by implementing the ConverstationArea API at the Router level, defining the API in terms of an HTTP endpoint (Task 1.1). Then, you will implement the business logic to create new ConversationAreas in a request handler, and in CoveyTownController (Task 1.2). Lastly, you’ll update the existing request handler that processes a player’s request to join a town so that this response also includes the list of current ConversationAreas (Task 1.3). Task 1.1: Add an HTTP route to create conversation areas [5 points] . Your first task is to add a request handler to the TownsService to receive client requests to create a new conversation. In the Towns Service architecture diagram above, this task will require modifying the Router to know about our new REST API endpoint. Avery has already decided on the API’s specification, and in fact has already also created a client that coforms to that specification - so you will be able to start testing your implementation right away. Here is the specification of the new route that you need to add for this API: . | URL: /towns/:townID/conversationAreas (where :townID is a parameter that specified the town in which the conversation area should be created) | HTTP Method: post | Body: JSON, the body matches the type ConversationAreaCreateRequest, defined in src/client/TownsServiceClient.ts and reproduced below | . /** * Payload sent by the client to create a new conversation area */ export interface ConversationAreaCreateRequest { coveyTownID: string; sessionToken: string; conversationArea: ServerConversationArea; } . Avery’s sanity test for this task uses their API client to make a request to create a conversation area. You can run it right now, by running the command npm test CoveyTownConversationAPI. Before you implement this task, you should expect to see the tests fail, with a message Request failed with status code 404 (404 is the error code that indicates that an address does not exist). The route. Following the example routes that already exist in router/towns.ts, create the new route as specified above in the file router/towns.ts. Your route should follow the conventions in the other routes: forward the request on to the conversationAreaCreateHandler and record the response. If conversationAreaCreateHandler throws no error, then return the response from the handler as JSON, with the HTTP status code OK. If conversationAreaCreateHandler throws an error, log the error and return a response with HTTP status INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, a JSON response of {message: 'Internal server error, please see log in server for more details'}. The router interfaces with the HTTP server through the variable app, which in our case, is a library called ExpressJS. For tips on working with Express, see the ExpressJS routing docs . 📝 Check your work: When you run the sanity test, it should still fail, but this time with the message “Error processing request: This feature is not yet implemented” (the default behavior of conversationAreaCreateHandler). If you get this message, then you have successfully completed this first task! . Note: Due to the complexity of writing these tests to work with partial implementations, the GradeScope tests for Task 1.1 will not pass until after you get to Task 1.3. The Task 1.2 tasks do not have this dependency: so once you are fairly certain that Task 1.1 is implemented correctly, continue with the rest of Task 1, and don’t expect the GradeScope tests for Task 1.1 to pass until after you implement 1.3. Task 1.2: Implement business logic to create a conversation area [45 points total] . With the top of the architecture stack implemented, it’s now time to implement some business logic to actually create a conversation area. This task will require you to implement three methods, and you will receive partial credit for this task at the level of each of the implementation methods: . | conversationAreaCreateHandler [15 points] | addConversationArea [30 points] | . Task 1.2a conversationAreaCreateHandler [15 points] . When the conversationAreaCreateHandler is called, it should: . | Validate that the supplied session token is a valid token for the specified town | Delegate the actual responsibility for creating the conersation area to the CoveyTownController, invoking the addConversationArea method on the appropriate town controller. | . If the token is valid and the conversation area is successfully created, set return the isOK parameter on the returned response to true, the response property to {}, and the message to undefined. If not successful for any reason, set the return isOK to false, and set the message to exactly the string: Unable to create conversation area &lt;conversationAreaLabel&gt; with topic &lt;conversationAreaTopic&gt; (replacing the values in &lt;&gt; with the parameters that were passed). For example, if a request to create a conversation area with label foo and topic bar fails, the returned message should be Unable to create conversation area foo with topic bar. 📝 Check your work: When you run the API sanity test suite (npm test CoveyTownConversationAPI), you should now see “Executes without error when creating a new conversation” succeed. Other tests may fail. Task 1.2b addConversationArea [30 points] . Implement the method addConversationArea method in CoveyTownController. Recall from the architectural diagram above that the CoveyTownController is responsible for keeping track of all of the state regarding a single town, including its conversation areas. Avery has already added a private field, _conversationAreas to CoveyTownController. Your task is to implement the addConversationArea method, which should have the following behavior: . | Check that the topic is defined: it is not permitted to create a conversation area an empty string as the topic, if this is the case return false. | Check to see if there is an existing conversation area with the requested label, and if one already exists, return false. | Check to see if the boundingBox of the new conversation area overlaps with any existing, and if so, return false. | Boxes are allowed to be adjacent that is, two conversation areas may share boundary points. | The x, y position of the box denotes the center of the box on the map, height and width represent the overall height and width of the box. | . | Any players who are in the region defined by the boundingBox of the new conversation area should be added to it as occupants, and those players should have their _activeConversationArea property set to that new conversation area. | A player is defined as inside of a box if the x, y position of the player is anywhere within the bounding box. A player who overlaps only with the edge of a conversation area’s bounding box is not in the box. | This behavior only applies when a conversation area is created. After the conversation area is created, the server does not rely on the x,y position of a player to determine which conversation area they are in, and instead relies on the players’ self-reported location.conversationLabel as the source of truth. | . | Notify all listeners that are subscribed to this town that the newly created conversation area was created, by invoking onConversationAreaUpdated(theNewConversationArea) on each. | . This is a much bigger task than the first one. Note that you will undoubtedly find it useful to add new helper methods (private or public), perhaps in CoveyTownController, Player, or both. You must not add additional fields to track the conversation area’s state: the data model that Avery defined is the data model that you must use! . 📝 Check your work: Avery has also provided a single unit test for addConversationArea, which you can run with npm test -- -t 'CoveyTownController addConversationArea'. You can also run this test directly in VSCode. Of course, you may find it useful to write additional tests (either writing new tests, or modifying the behavior of this one to check more interesting behaviors). There is also a complete test suite for this task on GradeScope. Task 1.3: Include current conversation areas in join response [10 points] . If you completed task 1.2 correctly, then all players who are in the town when a new converation is made will be notified of the new converation area. The last task to complete before we can move on to frontend implementation of this feature is to update the backend service to include the list of all current conversation areas when a new player joins the town. In the file CoveyTownRequestHandler.ts, examine the method townJoinHandler and the type TownJoinResponse. Your objective for this task is to update the TownJoinResponse type to include a new field, conversationAreas, of type ServerConversationArea[], and to update the townJoinHandler to include the current list of converation areas for the town that the user has joined. 📝 Check your work: Run npm test CoveyTownConversationAPI again, you should now see the test “Includes newly created conversations when a new player joins” pass. Checkpoint, check your work on this entire task . We suggest that you submit your code at this point on GradeScope, which will run Avery’s extremely thorough test suite on your code. If there are test errors, you will likely find it easier to debug them now rather than moving on to implement more code (and perhaps introduce more bugs). ",

    "title": "Part 2: Completing the TownService responsibilities [30 points total]",
    "content": "Congratulations on making it this far! You are almost done, there are only two more tasks to complete the feature. Task 2.1: Track conversation area participants [15 points] . In Avery’s design, each of the users connected to a town track which conversation area (if any) they are in, and send this information to the CoveyTownController. The CoveyTownController needs to track which users are in each conversation. CoveyTownController has a method updatePlayerLocation, which is called each time that a player’s location changes. You should use the conversationLabel property on the UserLocation that is passed to updatePlayerLocation to identify the user’s current conversation area (as reported by that user). You should preserve the existing behavior of updatePlayerLocation, in particular, ensuring that onPlayerMoved is still emitted . Your objective for this task is to implement functionality so that at the end of the execution of this method, the _conversationAreas list tracked by the town controller reflects that player’s transition between conversation areas, updating the occupantsByID property on any effected conversation areas. You must also update the Player instance, setting the property activeConversationArea to point to the corresponding ServerConversationArea in the _conversationAreas array (or undefined if they are no longer within one). If any conversation areas are updated, you must emit a onConversationAreaUpdated event, similarly to how you did in Task 1.2 when a conversation is created. Note that you might need to send multiple onConversationAreaUpdated events: one for a user leaving an area and one for them entering another. It is important that no client ever believe that a user is in two conversation areas at the same time. Hence, be sure to send the “exit” update before the “enter” update. 📝 Check your work: Again, Avery has provided a single sanity test that checks some of the behavior defined above. You can run this test with the command npm test -- -t 'CoveyTownController updatePlayerLocation', and you might also consider extending it. Task 2.2: Remove participants from conversation area if they disconnect [10 points] . When a player disconnects from the server, there is no “movement” that happens, but any resources used by that player are cleaned up by the CoveyTownController’s destroySession method. Update destroySession to remove disconnected players from any conversation area that they had been a participant in and emit any onConversationAreaUpdated events as necessary. 📝 Check your work: Avery has not provided you with a sanity test for this task. Consider testing it manually, or enhance the sanity test that they provided to test this behavior. Task 2.3: Automatically end a conversation area when it’s unoccupied [5 points] . Avery has implemented logic on the frontend to show a default greeting message when there is no conversation area defined for a space. The code that you are implementing, then, needs to notify the frontend when a conversation area becomes unoccupied. When the last player leaves a conversation area emit the onConversationAreaDestroyed(destroyedArea:ServerConversationArea) event to each of the town controller’s listeners, and then remove that conversation area from the town controller’s list of conversation areas. When the last player leaves a conversation area, there is no need to emit a onConversationAreaUpdated. 📝 Check your work: Avery has not provided you with a sanity test for this task. Consider testing it manually, or enhance the sanity test that they provided to test this behavior. ",

Added hints for Jest syntax. | . Welcome back! We were very pleased to see your thorough implementation of the new conversation areas API. We are certain that this new design and implementation will be a solid foundation for Covey.Town in the years to come. Before we move on to implement the frontend portion of this feature, however, there is one last matter to discuss: testing. Unfortunately, we are seeing a recurring pattern with Avery’s development practices: just like Avery’s first implementation of covey.town was poorly documented and structured… so are Avery’s tests. While we were able to use Avery’s tests to do some quality assurance on your conversation area implementation, we really do not want to rely on them going forward: they will be a nightmare for maintenance — they violate many of our test design principles, have duplicated code, and are quite brittle. Avery doesn’t know how to use mocks or spies very well, and struggles with writing focused unit tests. Our lead test engineer, Ripley, has done some research into Jest’s Mock and Spy API and also found the Jest mock-extended package. Ripley would like you to implement a new test suite for the Conversation Area feature - primarily unit tests that make use of mocks and spies. These tests will be quite useful in the coming months and years of the project, and will allow the rest of the team to maintain and enhance the conversation area feature as the overall system needs change. Clarification, 2/28: In order to effectively test some methods (like updatePlayerLocation), your tests might need to also invoke other methods (like addConversationArea). That is absolutely OK - these two methods rely on a shared agreement of how the conversation areas are stored in the controller, and in this case, calling addCoversationArea in a test for updatePlayerLocation is the best way to test updatePlayerLocation. You may find similar coupling between other methods — this is why we say that the definition of a “unit” test versus an “integration” test is lies somewhere on a broad spectrum, and “unit” is not precisely defined as “testing a single method of a single class”. We will grade your tests on several criteria: . | Do your tests pass on correct (non-buggy) code? (Checked automatically by GradeScope) | Do your tests fail when run on buggy code? (Checked automatically by GradeScope) | Are your tests qualitatively “good,” as defined in the week 5 lessons? (Checked manually) | . Based on past experiences, we project that this assignment could take you up to 18 hours (depending on your prior preparation). We encourage you to start early so that you can post questions on Piazza, make the most use of our TAs’ tutorials, and attend office hours as necessary in order to ensure that you can reach full marks across the board. To get started, download the handout zip. Learning Objectives . The objectives of this assignment are to: . | Practice writing integration-level tests using TypeScript and Jest | Practice writing unit tests using TypeScript and Jest, including techniques like spies and mocks | Gain experience measuring test suite adequacy using mutation testing | . Grading . Your tests will automatically be evaluated for linter errors and warnings. Submissions that have any linter errors will automatically receive a grade of 0. Do not wait to run the linter until the last minute. Your tests will be accepted by the autograder only if they have no linter errors/warnings, and if they all pass on the non-buggy conversation area implementation that we have provided in the handout. Your tests will be graded based on their ability to detect injected faults, using the stryker mutation tool. We have divided the test suite into five units; each unit will be graded inividually based on the number of mutants that your test suite detects. Each unit has a target number of mutants for you to detect, please note that several mutants might be “coupled” (that is, detecting one implies detecting the other), so you may find that a few well-designed tests with strong assertions will detect many mutants. IMPORTANT UPDATE 3/1/22: Are you interested in learning how mutation testing works? If so, then feel free to run Stryker yourself. Are you currently stressed for time, trying to get through this assignment? Do not try to run stryker, and do not try to understand its output. Your objective is to write tests that detect bugs in the HW2 implementation that is included in this handout. You should do this by referring to the specification for HW2, and consider all of the different boundary cases (particularly error cases). Submit your code to GradeScope, and it will tell you if you find all of the bugs. Your code will be manually evaluated for conformance to our course style guide. This manual evaluation will account for 10% of your total grade on this assignment. We will manually evaluate your code for style on the following rubric: . To receive all 10 points: . | All new names (e.g. for local variables, methods, and properties) follow the naming conventions defined in our style guide | Your tests should primarily be written as unit tests (directly testing the specified code units), rather than integration tests | Your tests are structured in a meaningful manner, with tests for the same unit nested within a shared describe block. | The code that you write generally follows the design principles discussed in week one. In particular, your design does not have duplicated code that could have been refactored into a shared method, including common test code that could be refactored into a beforeEach or beforeAll. | . We will review your code and note each violation of this rubric. We will deduct two points for each violation, up to a maximum of deducting all 10 style points. General Requirements . This is an individual assignment. Please post any questions about this assignment on Piazza. We have many sections of this class, and we want to make sure that we respond to your questions the same way, regardless of which section you are in. You must implement all unit tests for CoveyTownController in the file src/lib/CoveyTownController.test.ts, and all other tests in the file src/client/CoveyTownConversationAPI.test.ts. Please feel free to remove or modify any existing conversation area tests in these files. You may add additional helper methods to these files, and you may add beforeEach, beforeAll, afterEach, or afterAll to these test suites. If you would like to create shared utilities for your tests, you may implement them in the file src/client/TestUtils.ts. Your tests must be fully contained within these test files and TestUtils.ts - when they run on GradeScope, we will copy only these files out of your submission to grade. You may implement your test suite in any order that you would like, but we provide a suggested ordering in the assignment. A helpful debugging strategy for writing effective tests is to manually inject some fault into the code under test, and then modify your test until it fails on this buggy code. This process is much faster than running a complete mutation analysis. However, if you would like to run the mutation analysis before submitting to GradeScope, you can do so by using the command npx stryker run in the project directory. After several minutes, a report will be generated to reports/mutation/html/index.html - you can open this report in your browser and see which mutants are not “killed” (the words “detected” and “killed” are used interchangably to refer to mutants that your test suite identifies as bugs; we prefer the term “detected”). You may notice that there could be additional defects that would not be represented by a mutation. Your tests will not be graded on their ability to detect any defects other than the mutations specified. You may not make changes to package.json or to the lint configuration. You may not use ts-ignore or eslint-disable annotations. Jest might also report the following message after running some tests: . Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed. This usually means that there are asynchronous operations that weren't stopped in your tests. Consider running Jest with `--detectOpenHandles` to troubleshoot this issue. Ripley and Avery can’t figure out how to get rid of this, and it’s mostly harmless. Please ignore it, although if you do happen to figure out a fix, please feel free to let us know so that we can share it with Ripley and Avery! . General Jest Hints . If you would like to mock a request handler, this is the easiest syntax to use: . import * as requestHandlers from '../requestHandlers/CoveyTownRequestHandlers'; ... jest.spyOn(requestHandlers, 'nameOfRequestHandler').mock... If you need to expect that some async function throws an error, you may find the jest reference on error handling to be useful. Please feel free to post general questions about Jest usage as public posts on Piazza. Testing CoveyTownController.destroySession (5 points) . HW2 Part 2.2 describes that when a player’s session is destroyed, they should be removed from the conversation area. This test is a great place to start. Take a look at the tests at the bottom of CoveyTownController.test.ts for examples of unit tests for similar functionality. Hint: You may be able to reuse many of the mocking patterns that already exist in this test suite. Bug detection thresholds: . | Detect 1 bug - 5 points | . Testing CoveyTownController.updatePlayerLocation (30 points) . HW2 Part 2.1 describes the expected behavior for updatePlayerLocation. Implement a suite of tests that directly call this method and check for the specification. Bug detection thresholds: . | Detect 20 bugs: 10 points | Detect 24 bugs: 22 points | Detect 26 bugs: 30 points | . Testing CoveyTownController.addConversationArea (35 points) . HW2 Part 1.2b describes the expected behavior for addConversationArea. Implement a suite of tests that directly call this method and check for the specification. Hint (added 2/27/22): The implementation of createConversationForTesting that we have provided you can not be used to create a conversation area object with a falsy topic or label, due to the line topic: params?.conversationTopic || nanoid(). Feel free to modify this method, or to modify one of the properties of the returned object. Bug detection thresholds: . | Detect 47 bugs: 10 points | Detect 62 bugs: 25 points | Detect 70 bugs: 35 points | . Testing CoveyTownRequestHandlers.conversationAreaCreateHandler (10 points) . HW2 Part 1.2a describes the expected behavior for conversationAreaCreateHandler. Implement a suite of tests that directly call this method and check for the specification. Ripley has porvided a helpful starter test in CoveyTownConversationAPI.test.ts - feel free to modify or extend this test (or delete it, if you do not find it useful). Bug detection thresholds: . | Detect 3 bugs: 5 points | Detect 4 bugs: 10 points | . Testing Towns.ts POST route for /towns/:townID/conversationAreas (10 points) . With all of the individual components for adding conversation areas unit tested, your last step is to write some integration tests that can check that the REST service is correctly implemented. You can find an example of this kind of test in CoveyTownConverationAPI.test.ts. These tests likely need only check that the error messages and HTTP status codes specified in HW2 Part 1.1 are correctly implemented. Bug detection thresholds: . | Detect 2 bugs: 10 points | . ",

    "content": "The lower part of the sidebar is the ConversationAreasList, which displays a list of “active” conversation areas, along with their occupants. A conversation area is “active” if its topic is not set to the constant NO_TOPIC_STRING that is exported from the ConverationArea file. Calin provides the following specification for the ConversationAreasList: . | If there are no active conversation areas, it displays the text “No active conversation areas” | If there are active areas, it sorts them by label ascending, using an alphanumeric sort (e.g. area9 appears before area10), and displaying only active areas | Each active conversation area is represented as its own component. You must author and name this component, locating it in the ConversationAreasList.tsx file. The component should contain, within a ChakraUI Box: . | A heading (h3), with the text: {conversationAreaLabel}: {conversationAreaTopic}, | An unordered list of occupants: . | Occupants are unsorted, appearing in the order that they appear in the area’s occupants array. Each occupant is rendered by a &lt;PlayerName&gt; component, nested within a ListItem. | . | An useEffect hook, which subscribes to occupancy updates by registering an onOccupantsChange listener on the component’s corresponding conversation area object: . | The listener must be registered exaclty once (when the component is mounted), and unregistered exactly once (when the component is unmounted) | The listener must update the rendered list of occupants in the conversation area when it receives updates | . | . | . Please refer to the usePlayersInTown and useConversationAreas hooks to find the relevant state that this component must display. Your component may not mutate the arrays returned by these hooks. Note (added 3/16): To pass the test suite, your components may only use useEffect for subscribing to the onOccupantsChange event (as described above), and must not use any useEffect hooks for other purposes. If you would like to cache some information (like the list of sorted conversation areas), feel free to use useMemo for this purpose. However, it is also not necessary that you do any such caching. This note is only applicable if you are struggling to determine why your components fail the tests that use mock useEffect calls. Your grade for this part of the assignment will be computed based on the set of tests that you pass.

We’re just about ready to call the “conversation areas” feature a wrap, and release it! After using the prototype feature for the past few weeks, our UX designer Calin has suggested that we add some additional functionality so that users can see an overview of the activity going on within the town. Calin has sketched out a simple interface, the “social sidebar,” that will list the usernames of all of the players in the town, as well as a listing of all of the occupied conversation areas. This will help users to see where the activity is going on, since the map can be quite large. This feature will also provide useful abstractions for future features that might provide more social features. A screenshot of the prototype of the social sidebar appears below: . The interface is quite utilitarian (with very little effort on aesthetics), but functional. The goal for this assignment is to implement this interface. Calin provided the specification for this assignment to Ripley, who implemented a very thorough test suite, which is provided to you with the handout. Based on past experiences, we project that this assignment could take you up to 18 hours (depending on your prior preparation). We encourage you to start early so that you can post questions on Piazza, make the most use of our TAs’ tutorials, and attend office hours as necessary in order to ensure that you can reach full marks across the board. To get started, download the handout zip. Learning Objectives . The objectives of this assignment are to: . | Write React components that make use of state | Use React hooks | Analyze Chakra UI documentation and write new code that uses widgets from this library | Write new TypeScript code that uses asynchronous operations | . Grading . Your code will automatically be evaluated for linter errors and warnings. Submissions that have any linter errors will automatically receive a grade of 0. Do not wait to run the linter until the last minute. Your code will be automatically evaluated for functional correctness by the test suite that is distributed in the handout. Your SocialSidebar will not be evalauted on its visual aesthetics - it need not look exactly like the screenshot above. The tests check only for conformance to the specification, which outlines several key landmark UI elements (e.g. heading levels, list structure). Your code will be manually evaluated for conformance to our course style guide. This manual evaluation will account for 10% of your total grade on this assignment. We will manually evaluate your code for style on the following rubric: . To receive all 10 points: . | All new names (e.g. for local variables, methods, and properties) follow the naming conventions defined in our style guide | All public properties and methods (other than getters, setters, and constructors) are documented with JSDoc-style comments that describes what the property/method does, as defined in our style guide | The code that you write generally follows the design principles discussed in week one. In particular, your design does not have duplicated code that could have been refactored into a shared method. | . We will review your code and note each violation of this rubric. We will deduct two points for each violation, up to a maximum of deducting all 10 style points. General Requirements . This is an individual assignment. Please post any questions about this assignment on Piazza. We have many sections of this class, and we want to make sure that we respond to your questions the same way, regardless of which section you are in. You must implement the entire assignment within the files PlayersList.tsx and ConversationAreasList.tsx, both within the directory frontend/src/copmonents/SocialSidebar in the handout. Part 1 of the assignemnt will be contained entirely within PlayersList.tsx, and Part 2 within ConversationAreasList.tsx. To pass the tests, your components must have no warnings regarding missing or duplicate keys. You may not make changes to package.json or to the lint configuration. You may not use ts-ignore or eslint-disable annotations. To run the app locally, please refer to the README in the Covey.Town repository. Your development will take place entirely within the frontend directory. You must run npm install in the frontend directory, and similarly, to run the linter, run npm run lint in the frontend directory. The handout contains components that are written as functional components in React. You might find examples online that refer to class-based components. Functional components use hooks to store state and perform effects when the component is first rendered or when it’s unmounted from the page. Class-based components use the setState method to store state, and callbacks like componentDidMount. We covered functional components in class, and this assignment requires you to write functional components. For references on how to maintain state in your component or how to perform actions when a component is first mounted on the page or when it’s removed from the page, we suggest that you stick to the React useState documentation and React useEffect documentation. There are quite a few resources that instead describe the class-based API, and these might be confusing (since they are not applicable). Hint 3/24: Please, be sure to follow the rules of hooks, some of which are automatically enforced by the linter, but others of which you might not receive automated warnings for. We will not be manually deducting points for violations of these rules, but we do not believe that it is possible to pass all of the tests if these rules are violated (because React will behave unexpectedly). Those rules, in brief are: . | Only call hooks (useEffect() or useState()) at the top level: not in loops, conditionals, or nested functions | Only call hooks from React function components (not from helper functions) | . Note that it might be tempting, because the component is a function, to instantiate your component Foo by calling the function, as in: Foo({paramA=b}). This style is an anti-pattern in React, and likely to yield test failures that are otherwise unexplainable. Please, be sure to instantiate the components as we have in our slides and resources, and as in the React documentation, using TSX, as in: &lt;Foo paramA={b} /&gt;. The handout contains an automated test suite, which you can run with the command npm test from within the frontend directory. To run only one of the test suites, run the command npm test testName where testName is either PlayersList or ConversationAreasList. Each test has a prefix [Tx], where Tx corresponds to “Task X” in the rubrics below. ",

    "content": "Building, delivering and maintaining successful software products requires more than being good at programming. Software engineering encompasses the tools and processes that we use to design, construct and maintain programs over time. Software engineering has been said to consider the “multi person development of multi version programs.” Development processes that work well for a single developer do not scale to large or even medium-sized teams. Similarly, development processes that work well for quickly delivering a one-off program to a client cause chaos when applied to a codebase that needs to be maintained and updated over months and years. This class will begin to explore these tradeoffs throughout the entire software development lifecycle, with a particular focus on how these decisions affect the quality of the resulting software. This class will serve as an introduction to the field of software engineering, covering key topics such as: . | Requirements gathering and specification How to make sure that you build the product that your customer really wants | Designing code for reuse, for readability, and for scale How to avoid reinventing the wheel? What makes code readable? Where does performance fit into designs? When do we decide when to revisit old design decisions, and how do we replace them? Can we avoid the mistakes that past developers have made? | How to organize your development process to collaborate effectively How do we communicate our designs with others? How do we structure and coordinate development activities? How do we measure the performance of these processes, and tweak them over time? | How to ensure that your code works, is secure, and broadly speaking, “does the right thing” How do we measure different quality attributes like usability, scalability and performance? How do we minimize the cost of defects? How do we automatically test complex systems? Can we automatically prove the absence of some kinds of defects? | . ",

The codebase that we’ll be developing on is a remote collaboration tool called Covey.Town. Covey.Town provides a virtual meeting space where different groups of people can have simultaneous video calls, allowing participants to drift between different conversations, just like in real life. Covey.Town is inspired by existing products like Gather.Town, Sococo, and Gatherly.IO — but it is an open source effort, and the features will be proposed and implemented by you! All implementation will take place in the TypeScript programming language, using React for the user interface. At the end of the semester, the instructors and TAs will evaluate all of the student projects, and select the best (in terms of usability, code quality, test suite quality, and overall design) to merge into the open source Covey.Town codebase on GitHub repository. No additional course credit will be awarded to these teams, but these students will have the opportunity to receive public recognition for their project (in the form of a pull request merged into our repository and acknowledgements in the project’s contributors list). The project will provide hands-on experience to complement the skills taught in this class, requiring students to be able to: . | Work effectively in a small team | Enumerate and prioritize development tasks | Propose, design, implement and test a new feature in an existing non-toy software application | Write code that their team members can read and review | Review teammates’ code | Analyze a proposed software architecture | Use relevant software tools, such as: . | TypeScript | Visual Studio Code (or similar IDE) | Git | Mocha and Jest | Twilio’s Programmable Video API | Postman | . | .

After your release is created, you’ll find that there is now a .zip that can be downloaded from GitHub that contains a snapshot of your entire repository. Download this zip file, unpack it, and follow the instructions that you provided in your README to double-check that the course staff will be able to run your project (this step is handy to make sure that you didn’t forget to include some key files in git). If needed, you can delete the release, make some changes, and re-release up until the deadline. Submit this zip file to Canvas under the assignment “Final Project - Code Submission”. Submit your report separately to Canvas, under the assignment “Final Project - Report Submission”. Project Demo . Details for project demos will be provided during class by each instructor.

    "title": "Grading",
    "content": "Each project will be graded by the team’s assigned TA mentor, and the instructor. We do not expect all teams to deliver all of the features that were initially proposed - in the five week implementation period, there are sure to be some teams that encounter unexpected technical hurdles. As described in greater detail in the rubrics below, teams that have regular communication with their TA regarding their project status may be permitted to variances to their project scope. For most of the submisison components below, we provide two benchmark rubrics: one for a submission that is satisfactory (full marks), and one that would be meeting our minimum expectations (a pass). Rubric for remaining components will be provided by individual instructors. In practice, when grading projects we will assign numeric grades and provide partial credit, using these rubrics as guidelines for those two extremes. Overall project is worth 35% of the course. In cases where team members do not equally contribute to the project, we may assign different grades to different individuals, up to an extreme of deducting 50% of the marks from a student. We will evaluate each individual’s contribution on the basis of a variety of factors, including progress reports at weekly meetings, through inspecting version control history, through each students’ self-reflection, and through each students’ peer evaluation {during and/or} at the end of the project. We will make regular efforts to collect and distribute this feedback throughout the project — our ultimate goal is for all students to participate and receive full marks. 20% Delivered Features . We will grade each delivered project holistically using the following two rubrics: . Satisfactory: . | Implemented feature satisfies the conditions of satisfaction as proposed by the team and as agreed to by the course staff. If technical difficulties resulted in features being dropped, the project may still earn full marks on “delivered features,” but these difficulties must have been documented with the course staff as you encountered them during development. | Implemented feature is deployed to a publicly-accessible URL, using Netlify and Heroku for hosting as outlined in the Week 8 Activity | Implemented feature contains no ESLint warnings or errors; does not include any eslint-disable or ts-ignore flags | . Meets minimum requirements: . | Implemented feature largely satisfies acceptance criteria as proposed by the team, but may not meet the course staff’s interpretation of those criteria. | Implemented feature is deployed to a publicly-accessible URL, using Netlify and Heroku for hosting as outlined in the Week 8 Activity | The implementation may have some obvious flaws, but largely works without crashing. | Implemented feature does not include any eslint-disable or ts-ignore flag | . 10% Testing . The project must include evidence of testing. Ideally, all new features will be accompanied by fully automated tests, but in some circumstances (particularly when engaging with Phaser, the game library), this may not be feasible. If automated tests are not possible, include a discusison of your manual testing strategy, including a script that a future developer could use to manually test the feature. Satisfactory: . | Any new or modified backend features include tests that validate that the feature works as intended. These tests cover the changed code, and also contain well-written assertions that thoroughly check the expected behaviors. | Tests contains no ESLint warnings or errors; does not include any eslint-disable or ts-ignore flags | . Meets minimum requirements: . | Any new or modified backend features include at least one test, which may or may not be an effective test. | Tests may contain ESlint warnings (but no errors); does not include any eslint-disable or ts-ignore flags | . 10% Project Pitch . Each team’s project pitch grade will account for 10% of the overall grade for the project. 10% Project Plan . Each team’s project plan grade will account for 10% of the overall grade for the project. 10% Weekly meetings, demonstrations of progress and evaluations . Throughout the semester, each team will be meeting with their TA mentor and with the instructor to discuss their project progress. Attendance at these meetings and demonstrations of progress will, cumulatively, account for 10% of the project grade. Each instructor will provide a more detailed rubric for this section of the assignment. 5% Evidence of Development Process . Each team is expected to use their GitHub repository, regularly committing changes while developing their project. Satisfactory: . | There is a clear development history visible from the git repository: features were delivered incrementally, and not in a single (or several) commits at the end of the project | There is evidence of code review - for example, pull requests that have comments on them | There is a correspondence between commit messages and the technical tasks that they are associated with; there are few (if any) commits with meaningless commits messages like . or Add files via upload. | Each team member has made at least 2 commits over the lifespan of the project | . Meets minimum requirements: . | There is a clear development history visible from the git repository: features were delivered incrementally, and not in a single (or several) commits at the end of the project | Each team member has made at least 2 commits over the lifespan of the project | . Final Report . The final report should consist of three sections: . 10% Report – Feature Overview . Satisfactory: . | The Feature section contains sufficient documentation for a user to interact with your updated version of Covey.Town. | The documentation covers all steps that the user would need to take to exercise all of your user stories. | Screenshots are included that capture the key interactions between a user and your new feature. | Course staff were able to follow these instructions to successfully interact with your project implementation. | The section is at most 4 pages (roughly 2,000 words maximum), NOT including figures — fewer pages are absolutely acceptable, consider this a rough limit | . Meets minimum requirements: . | The Feature contains documentation for a user to interact with your updated version of Covey.Town, but perhaps does not fully describe how. | The documentation includes at least one or two screenshots, but screenshots do not capture interactions with all of the user stories. | The course staff were able to figure out how to use it through trial and error. | The section is at most 4 pages, NOT including figures — fewer pages are absolutely acceptable, consider this a rough limit | . 10% Report - Technical Overview . Satisfactory: . | Technical Overview contains a description of any substantive changes to the existing Covey.Town codebase, and the architecture of your new code. | It uses CRC cards, or state diagrams or any of the other techniques that help describe the structure. | It provides a well-reasoned rationale for why this is the “right” design. | The document is at most 2 pages (fewer pages are absolutely acceptable, consider this a rough limit) Meets minimum requirements: . | Technical Overview includes a description of all major changes to the code compared to our existing Covey.Town codebase. | The document is at most 2 pages (fewer pages are absolutely acceptable, consider this a rough limit) | . 5% Report - README . Satisfactory: . | The README section contains detailed instructions to deploy the application with your new feature - modified from our initial installation instructions to include any new setup necessary for your feature. | The course staff is able to follow these instructions to deploy your application. | The README section is at most 2 pages (fewer pages are absolutely acceptable, consider this a rough limit) | . Meets minimum requirements: . | The README section contains instructions to deploy the application with your new feature, perhaps missing key steps for installing/deploying the application | The course course staff were able to stumble through configuring it without contacting you. | The document is at most 2 pages (fewer pages are absolutely acceptable, consider this a rough limit) | . 10% Demonstration . Each instructor will provide details regarding expectations for the demo. The schedule and manner of these demos might also vary from section to section. ",

    "content": "The assignments and project for this class are designed to mirror the experiences of a software engineer joining a new development team: you will be “onboarded” to our codebase, make several individual contributions, and then form a team to propose, develop and implement a new feature. The codebase that we’ll be developing on is a remote collaboration tool called Covey.Town. Covey.Town provides a virtual meeting space where different groups of people can have simultaneous video calls, allowing participants to drift between different conversations, just like in real life. Covey.Town is inspired by existing products like Gather.Town, Sococo, and Gatherly.IO — but it is an open source effort, and the features will be proposed and implemented by you! All implementation will take place in the TypeScript programming language, using React for the user interface. Select projects from Spring 2022 are hosted in our project showcase. Overview of Project Deliverables . | Date | Deliverable | Description | . | 2/9/22 | Team Formation | Specify preferences for teammates | . | 2/18/22 | Kickoff Team Meeting | Meet with your assigned TA mentor to discuss your project concept | . | 2/25/22 | Project Pitch | Propose a new feature for Covey.Town that can be implemented within 5 weeks | . | 3/11/22 | Project Plan | Refine the scope of your feature based on staff feedback, define detailed requirements and project acceptance criteria. | . | 4/25/22 | Project Implementation and Documentation | Deliver your new feature, including design documentation and tests | . Team Formation . All projects will be completed in a team of 4-5 students. The very first deliverable for the project will be a team formation survey: you will be able to indicate your preferences for teammates. The instructors will assign students to the teams based on a number of factors including your responses to the survey. All students in each team must be in the same section of the class. Complete the team formation before Feb 9. Team Meetings with TA Mentor . Each team will be assigned a TA to act as a mentor, who will also serve as your point of contact for project grading. During the week of February 14-18, you will have a “Kickoff Meeting” with your TA mentor, where you will meet your TA mentor and have the opportunity to share any early ideas that you might want feedback on before submitting the project pitch. Once project begins in full force, you will have weekly meetings with your TA mentor (scheduled at your team’s and the TA’s convenience) in order to help ensure that you are making progress on the project, and to help address problems that you encounter (be they technical or non-technical problems). Project Pitch . All projects will involve frontend and backend development of a new feature for Covey.Town. Once teams have been formed, you and your team will decide what kind of new feature you would like to build. Your feature should be something that can be implemented within the timeframe allotted (5 weeks), and will be implemented in a fork of the main Covey.Town codebase. Given that you will be up-to-speed on the Covey.Town codebase (and have been introduced to TypeScript, React, NodeJS, and testing frameworks), and that you will have a team of four, we expect that the feature that you propose will be more complex than the feature implemented in the individual homeworks. The project pitch assignment will be released on February 11th. Creating a GitHub Repository . Your team’s development must take place within a private GitHub repository in our GitHub Classroom. To create your repository, one member of your team should follow these instructions: . | Sign in to GitHub.com, and then use our invitation to create a repository with the covey.town codebase. You should enter your group number (e.g. “Group 7Y”) as the team name. | Refresh the page, and it will show a link to your new repository, for example: https://github.com/neu-cs4530-s22/team-project-group-7y. Click the link to navigate to your new repository. This is the repository you will use for the project. | Add your teammates: . | From your repository page, click on “Settings” (Screenshot) | On the left hand sidebar, select “Collaborators and Teams” (Screenshot) | You will see a single team listed, which will be the group name that you entered when creating the repository. Click on that team name. (Screenshot) | From the next page, you can click on the “+” icon in order to add a team member (Screenshot) | Enter the GitHub.com username for your teammate. (Screenshot) | After confirming that you have selected the correct user, click the button to add your teammate. (Screenshot) | Repeat steps 4-6 for each of your teammates | . | . This repository will be private, and visible only to your team and the course staff. After the semester ends, you are welcome to make it public - you have complete administrative control of the repository. You should create your team’s repository before submitting your project plan - your TA will ask to confirm that you have created it when you meet. Project Plan . Based on the feedback that you receive from the course staff, you will propose a detailed plan to implement your new feature. The project plan will include: . | Revised user stories and conditions of satisfaction (based on feedback on the project pitch) | Revised design documents (based on feedback on the project pitch) | Work breakdown: Map your user stories to engineering tasks. Assign each task to a team member (or pair of team members), provide an estimate for how long each task will take, a rationale for that estimate, and schedule those stories into 2 week sprints. | . Your team will self-organize, as agile teams do and will use the work breakdown and schedule as the basis for weekly check-ins with your team’s TA. The project plan assignment is due by March 11. Project Implementation and Documentation . You will be assigned a mentor for your project who will work closely with you for the entire project. You will coordinate with the mentor to setup weekly meetings and regular sprint demos. Peer evaluation will also be used. Your final team deliverable will be a “release” of your new feature on GitHub (with tests), and will be accompanied by a demo. Optionally, you may also open a pull request to merge your feature into our main repository (submitting a pull request, or the pull request being merged into our codebase is independent of the grade you receive, but provides a platform for more visiblity of your project). Your final team deliverable will include: . | The implementation of your new feature | Automated tests for your new feature | A report | . Accompanying the final team deliverable will be an individual reflection, which every student must submit on their own, which will include your reflections on: . | The evolution of your project concept: How does the project that you delivered compare to what you originally planned to deliver? What caused these deviations? | The software engineering processes that you feel could have been improved in your project: were there any procesess that in hindsight, you wish that you followed, or wish that you followed better? | Your team dynamic: Provide a frank (and ideally, blameless) postmortem of your and your teammates collaborative performance and participation. If you had to do this same project over with the same teammates, what would you have done differently (or not) to improve your team’s overall performance? | .

Once teams have been formed, you and your team will decide what kind of new feature you would like to build. Your feature should be something that can be implemented within the timeframe allotted (5 weeks), and will be implemented in a fork of the main Covey.Town codebase. You can play with a demo deployment of the app at app.covey.town, and in the coming weeks, we will provide tutorials and instructions for you to run the entire application in a local development environment, and also to deploy it to the cloud. Given that you will be up-to-speed on the Covey.Town codebase (and have been introduced to TypeScript, React, NodeJS, and testing frameworks), and that you will have a team of four, we expect that the feature that you propose will be at least as complex as the feature implemented in the individual homeworks. Feel free to look at existing systems like Gather.Town, Sococo, Reslash, Screen, and Gatherly.IO for inspiration on new features to build for Covey.Town. Also see the recent NYTimes Magazine article The Race to Fix Fix Virtual Meetings (click here to access through NEU libraries). Examples of features that students might propose include: . | Create an interface for uploading and choosing between different maps and avatars (will require also learning to use the Phaser3 API) | Create an abstraction to allow for interaction with objects, for instance: walking up to a whiteboard on the map allows players to draw on a shared whiteboard | Add screenreader support - generate a textual representation of the map and what players can do to interact with it | Support real persistence: store data in a database (e.g. Postgres + GraphQL), allow users to register and save a profile (e.g. using Auth0) | Add direct messaging, image messaging, and other chat features | . Please note that multiple teams might choose to propose the same feature, or a variation of that same feature - this is OK. The course staff will provide feedback on your project to help ensure that the scope of your project is appropriate. When considering your project, please keep in mind that you will be allowed to publicly post your project online: while your immediate audience for the project is the course staff, if you are ultimately looking for software engineering jobs or co-ops, this project can be a useful piece of your portfolio. If you build a sufficiently maintainable feature (i.e., if your project is particularly well architected and tested), we will also consider pull requests to merge your feature into the main Covey.Town codebase on GitHub, allowing you to also tell recruiters that you have contributed a feature to an open source project on GitHub! . Your project pitch must include: . | An introductory problem statement: what problem in Covey.Town does your (proposed) feature solve? Provide a paragraph (or two) that describes why you are interested in building this feature. | User stories and acceptance criteria: high level description of how users will interact with your new feature. User stories are requirements specified in the format “As a &lt; type of user &gt;, I want &lt; some goal &gt; so that &lt; some reason &gt;.” My conditions of satisfaction are &lt; list of common cases and special cases that must work &gt;. You should include three different user stories to describe how users will interact with your feature. Your three user stories should cover the key behavior that your feature will provide. Do not provide more than three user stories. Your description of user stories and conditions of satisfaction should be between 2-4 pages. | Preliminary class-level design (CRC cards): Start to think about how you will implement this feature. What are the new classes that you are going to add to the Covey.Town codebase, and how will they interact with any existing classes? Create CRC cards that demonstrate the way that your feature will fit in with the existing codebase, creating cards for your new classes, and for any existing classes that you will anticipate modifying. Please refer to Lesson 2.4 (slides 20-21) for more details about CRC cards, and examples of CRC cards. Attach your CRC cards to your project pitch document. Your CRC cards should be between 2-4 pages. | . You can find good examples of user stories on this GSA website.

Start by considering each of your user stories, and identify what work needs to be done to implement each of them. Each work item should contain the following information: . | Task to be performed | User story (or stories) that this task relates to | Team member responsible for completing the task | T-shirt size estimate of how long will be needed to complete the task, using the following buckets: . | Small: Can likely be completed by one team member in one sitting of less than 3-4 hours | Medium: Likely to require involvement of multiple team members, over the course of 1-2 days | . | A brief (1-2 sentence max) justification of how you reached the size estimate of the task | Milestone for delivering the task, chosen from one of the following: . | Sprint 0: Mar 21-Mar 25 | Sprint 1: Mar 26-Apr 9 | Sprint 2: Apr 10-Apr 23 | . | . It is hard to say (generically) how many work items are necessary, but note that you must provide a rationale for each task that justifies why you believe that it can be accomplished within the time frame (be it a few hours, or a few days). You may find it useful as you iterate through your planning process to begin with several “Large” tasks (bigger than those allowable in the submission), and then do research (including reaching out to your TA mentor) to determine how to break these large tasks into several smaller tasks. Make sure to consider dependencies among tasks (this has to be done before that). Be realistic, and leave time for contingencies. Remember that you will need to have a demo prepared of your feature by 4/25 - just 5 weeks from the due date of this assignment. Be sure to leave time for testing and quality assurance. Your work breakdown can take the format of a simple textual list, or items scheduled in an issue tracker, like GitHub issues. You do not need to use any special format (such as Gantt or Pert charts). If you choose to create your work breakdown in an issue tracker, you may of course also use the issue tracker to schedule your tasks. ",

    "title": "Code Style",
    "content": "Programs are easier to read and to understand when they are written in a familiar style and follow standard coding conventions. Most organizations that develop software therefore require programmers to write programs that follow the organization’s preferred style and coding conventions. These conventions can be very elaborate. Many of the guidelines are, in fact, arbitrary. When you are working on a coding project with other developers, different developers often have preference for slightly different syntax, for instance: should our string literals be enclosed by single quotes (') or double quotes (\")? Should files be indented with spaces or tabs? In TypeScript, there are often multiple ways to accomplish the same goal, for instance, you could create a new empty array with the expression const myArray = new Array(), or const myArray = []. Sometimes there is no difference between these variants except for how it reads, and other times there may be unintended consequences of making the seemingly correct but subtly wrong choice. Thankfully, it is possible to write automated checkers (and, at times, fixers) for these style violations. All code that you write for this class will be checked by ESLint, and must be free of style warnings and errors. Our ESlint rules are derived from Airbnb’s JavaScript Style Guide, ESLint’s Recommended Rules, TypeScript/ESLint Recommended Rules, React ESLint Rules and React Hooks ESLint Rules. We do not suggest studying these lists directly, instead, begin writing code naturally, and allow your IDE’s built-in style checker to report issues as you find them. The most important rules to get started are: . | Indent using spaces, not tabs; use 2 spaces for each level of indentation | Enclose all string literals with single quotes, not double | Variables must be named using lowerCamelCase, types are named using UpperCamelCase. Constants (read-only variables that are assigned a static value once and not reused) must be named using UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES. | The maximum line length is 100 characters | . Naming . While the linter can automatically flag names that violate camelCase rules, it can not automatically determine that a name is “good” - this is a subjective judgement call. Please consider the following when choosing names: . | Names should be informative (e.g lineTooLong() rather than checkLineLength()) | Names for types are typically nouns or noun phrases. Interface names, however, might be adjectives (e.g. Serializable). Class names may be noun phrases that include the interface name (e.g. CuckooClock and DigitalClock for classes that implement the interface Clock). | Use noun-like names for functions or methods that return values (e.g. circleDiameter rather than calculateDiameter). (Exception: simple getters can still have names that begin with get). | Reserve verb-like names for functions that perform actions (e.g. addItem). | Use adjective phrases for predicates when possible (e.g. line.tooLong()) | Variable and property names should be descriptive of what the variable is for, and not be named after the type of the variable (which is captured in the variable’s type declaration) | Names for properties that are private must start with a _ | . Documentation and Comments . All public properties and methods (other than getters, setters, and constructors) must be documented using JSDoc-style comments that describes what the property/method does. Example: . /** The unique identifier for this player * */ private readonly _id: string; . /** * A handler to process a remote player's subscription to updates for a room * * @param socket the Socket object that we will use to communicate with the player */ . Consider adding comments within your code to describe non-obvious behavior, or to capture why the code is written the way that it is. Do not add comments that simply restate what can already be immediately discerned by reading the code. For example, here is a useful comment: . // No valid session exists for this token, hence this client's connection should be terminated socket.disconnect(true); return; . Here is a useless comment on the same code snippet: . // Disconnect the socket socket.disconnect(true); return; . Comments are for documentation, not for keeping track of old code you are no longer using (do not submit commented-out code). ",

For this class, you will need Node.js version 16 (16.13.2 is the latest version at time of writing, although any 16.x shoudl work in theory). There are many ways that you can install Node.js: for instance, you can use a package manager like snap or homebrew to install it; you can download an installer directly from the Node.js website, and you can, of course, build it from source. However, due to the complexity of running different Node.js versions on the same machine, we very strongly suggest using nvm, as explained below. We recommend installing Node.js using nvm, the node version manager. When language runtimes are in active development (like Node.js is), sometimes you end up needing to have multiple versions of Node.js installed, and different projects that you work on might require different versions of Node.js. These annoyances are quite rare, but when it happens that you need to have mutliple versions of Node.js installed, it’s super handy to have your system set up already so that installing multiple versions and switching between it is easy. You can use our instructions to set up nvm even if you have previously installed Node.js. ",

Troubleshooting with VSCode: Did you follow these instructions successfully, but find a “Command not found” error when you try to run npm in VSCode? Try this: Close VSCode completely. Re-open it.

    "title": "Types in typescript",
    "content": "Boolean . The boolean type has two values: true and false. Example: . let a = true // boolean var b = false // boolean const c = true // true let d: boolean = true // boolean let e: true = true // true . | Usage: You can compare them (with ==, ===, ||, &amp;&amp;, and ?), negate them (with !). | . Number . Number is the set of all numbers: integers, floats, positives, negatives, Infinity, NaN. Example: . var b = Infinity * 0.10 // number const c = 5678 // 5678 let d = a &lt; b // boolean let e: number = 100 // number let f: 26.218 = 26.218 . | Usage: Numbers can do things, like addition (+), subtraction (-), modulo (%), and comparison (&lt;). When working with long numbers, use numeric separators to make those numbers easier to read. | . BigInt . The bigint type is the set of all BigInts, and supports things like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and comparison (&lt;). Example: . let a = 1234n // bigint const b = 5678n // 5678n var c = a + b // bigint let d = a &lt; 1235 // boolean let e = 88.5n // Error TS1353: A bigint literal must be an integer. let f: bigint = 100n // bigint let g: 100n = 100n . | Usage: It lets you work with large integers without running into rounding errors. While the number type can only represent whole numbers it can hold numbers larger than 253 – 1. | . String . String is the set of all strings and the things you can do with them like concatenate (+), slice (.slice),etc. Example: . let a: any = 666 // any let b: any = ['danger'] // any let c = a + b // any . | Usage: Any functionality that requires the functionality of a string of characters. Here are a couple of string operations: | . charAt() : This method returns the character from the specified index. Characters in a string are indexed from left to right. The index of the first character is 0, and the index of the last character in a string, called stringName, is stringName.length – 1. Syntax: . string.charAt(index) . slice() : This method extracts a section of a string and returns a new string. Syntax: . string.slice( beginslice [, endSlice]) . split() : This method splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings. Syntax: . string.split([separator][, limit]) . concat(): This method adds two or more strings and returns a new single string. Syntax: . string.concat(string2, string3[, ..., stringN]) . indexOf(): This method returns the index within the calling String object of the first occurrence of the specified value, starting the search at index or -1 if the value is not found. Syntax: . string.indexOf(searchValue[, fromIndex]) . Arrays . Like in JavaScript, TypeScript arrays are special kinds of objects that support things like concatenation, pushing, searching, and slicing. Arrays are iterable Objects with the keys as numbers. Example: . let a = [1, 2, 3] // number[] var b = ['a', 'b'] // string[] let c: string[] = ['a'] // string[] let d = [1, 'a'] // (string | number)[] const e = [2, 'b'] // (string | number)[] let f = ['red'] f.push('blue') let g = [] // any[] g.push(1) // number[] g.push('red') // (string | number)[] let h: number[] = [] // number[] h.push(1) // number[] . Tuples . Tuples are subtypes of array. They’re a special way to type arrays that have fixed lengths, where the values at each index have specific, known types. Unlike most other types, tuples have to be explicitly typed when you declare them. Example: . let a: [number] = [1] // A tuple of [first name, last name, birth year] let b: [string, string, number] = ['malcolm', 'gladwell', 1963] . | Usage: In TypeScript Tuples support optional elements too. Just like in object types, ? means “optional”. Tuples also support rest elements, which you can use to type tuples with minimum lengths. Not only do tuple types safely encode heterogeneous lists, but they also capture the length of the list they type. | . Enums . Enums are a way to enumerate the possible values for a type. They are unordered data structures that map keys to values. Example: . enum Language { English, Spanish, Russian } . | Usage: There are two kinds of enums: enums that map from strings to strings, and enums that map from strings to numbers. Use it when you wish to provide flexibility making it easier to express and document intentions and use cases or when you want to save compile-time and runtime with inline code. | . Any . The any data type is the super type of all types in TypeScript. It denotes a dynamic type. Using the any type is equivalent to opting out of type checking for a variable. Example: . let a: any = 666 // any let b: any = ['danger'] // any let c = a + b // any . | Usage: In TypeScript everything needs to have a type at compile time, and any is the default type when you (the programmer) and TypeScript (the typechecker) can’t figure out what type something is. It’s a last resort type, and you should avoid it when possible. | . Unknown . If any is the Godfather, then unknown is Keanu Reeves as undercover FBI agent Johnny Utah in Point Break: laid back, fits right in with the bad guys, but deep down has a respect for the law and is on the side of the good guys. You can compare unknown values (with ==, ===, &amp;&amp;, and ?), and refine them (like you can any other type) with JavaScript’s typeof and instanceof operators. Example: . let a: unknown = 30 // unknown let b = a === 123 // boolean . | Usage: For the few cases where you have a value whose type you really don’t know ahead of time, don’t use any, and instead reach for unknown. Like any, it represents any value, but TypeScript won’t let you use an unknown type until you refine it by checking what it is. | . ",

Each of those child classes now implements a property or method, but they each may have their own way of performing that implementation. lternatively, one child class might override the parent’s members while another child doesn’t but just accepts the parent class’s implementation instead. This also demonstrates polymorphic behavior, since those behaviors are different between the siblings. class CheckingAccount { open(initialAmount: number) { // code to open account and save in database } } class BusinessCheckingAccount extends CheckingAccount { open(initialAmount: number) { if (initialAmount &lt; 1000) { throw new Error(\"Business accounts must have an initial deposit of 1.000 Euros\") } super.open(initialAmount); } } class PersonalCheckingAccount extends CheckingAccount { open(initialAmount: number) { if (initialAmount &lt;= 0) { throw new Error(\"Personal accounts must have an initial deposit of more than zero Euros\") } super.open(initialAmount); } } . In the above code sample shows, the two child classes have different business rules to implement when it comes to opening an account – mainly different opening balances. Because both children have a method to open the account but both children choose to do it differently means the behavior is polymorphic. To achieve polymorphism, inherit from a base class, then override methods and write implementation code in them. In addition to overriding methods, you can overload methods to achieve polymorphism. Overloaded methods are methods that have different signatures (i.e., different data types or number of arguments) with the same name. However, in TypeScript, methods aren’t overloaded by simply modifying the types or number of arguments like in some other languages. To create an overload in TypeScript, you can either add optional arguments to a method, or overload function declarations in an interface and implement the interface. ",

A developer creates a type, i.e., a class or interface, and that type specifies what the calling code should implement, but not how. So it’s the job of the abstract type to define what needs to be done, but up to the consuming types to actually do those things. To enforce abstraction, inherit or implement from abstract classes and interfaces. For example, some bank accounts have fees. You can create a Fee interface that defines a method for charging a fee. Fees don’t apply to all types of accounts, so it’s best to create an interface that can be applied to specific classes anywhere in the inheritance hierarchy. A checking account might charge fees, where its parent and sibling, the generic bank account and savings accounts might not. interface Fee { chargeFee(amount: number ); } // parent BankAccount and sibling SavingsAccount do not implement Fee interface class BankAccount { ... } class SavingsAccount extends BankAccount { ... } // checking implements Fee class CheckingAccount extends BankAccount implements Fee { chargeFee(amount: number) {} } . Children classes inherit interface members that have been implemented in their parent, so if a BusinessChecking account has inherited from the CheckingAccount class, then it inherits that implementation. // BusinessChecking inherits CheckingAccount and therefore Fee class BusinessChecking extends CheckingAccount { … } // Code that uses BusinessChecking can call chargeFee function CalculateMonthlyStatements() { let businessChecking = new BusinessChecking(); businessChecking.chargeFee(100); } .

Unit testing is not a new concept; it has been around for a long time. “Unit tests are often automated tests prepared and executed by software engineers to check that a portion of an application (referred to as a “unit”) matches its design and behaves as expected,” according to Wikipedia. So, to put it another way, it’s a technique to undertake rigorous testing of every single function/module in isolation. Unit testing technques: . | Black Box Testing : It is a process of validating a function’s input and output without any knowledge of it’s internal implementation details. | White Box Testing : Unlike Black Box testing, white box testing focuses on testing the specific internal code flows, uncovering any unidentified error or bug in that component. | Gray Box Testing : Gray Box testing is a combination of the two above wherein partial knowledge of the internal code is needed. This strategy lowers a tester’s reliance on a developer for every minor issue, allowing the tester to detect and resolved it alone. | . ",

    "content": "To understand the basics of unit testing, let us look at the file called ‘calculator.ts’ present in the directory src/services/math/. This file contains a class called Calculator with a method for add() defined as shown below: . // Contents of src/services/math/calculator.ts export default class Calculator { public add(num1: number, num2: number): number { const result: number = num1 + num2; console.log(\"The result is: \", result); return result; } } . Let us write some tests for this code using jest. The test code will go into a file in the same directory titled ‘calculator.spec.ts’. Create this file now. This pattern of ‘file-name.spec.ts’ is how you should name all of your test files when using jest. All test files start with a suite. A suite is a collection of tests (or a logical grouping of tests). In jest, a suite is created by using the function describe(). The suite takes 2 arguments: the 1st being the description of the suite and the second being a callback function. Additionally, suites can be nested to form logical groups. Suites can further be broken down into 3 components that we will explore in detail shortly: . | Setup | Teardown | Test | . Syntax: . describe(\"Description of suite\", () =&gt; { // The tests go here. }); . Suites can be used to make debugging easier when you are using a large number of tests. Here is one recommended suite hierarchy: . | Top level describe should contain the file path after src. | Second describe should contain the name of the Class/File being tested. | Subsequent describe blocks should contain the name of the function being tested. | . Using this hierarchy, the test file for the above example would look as follows: . describe(\"services &gt; math\", () =&gt; { describe(\"Calculator\", () =&gt; { describe(\"add()\", () =&gt; { // Tests for add() go here. }); }); }); . Specs . A spec is an actual test that executes some code and asserts some result. A test is created using the keyword it() or test(). Similar to describe(), it() takes 2 arguments, the first being the description of the test and the second being a callback. Generally, we want to describe what the code should do in the description of it() and assert the described behavior within the test. Each test can be broken down into 3 parts (Assemble, Act, Assert) which makes up the AAA pattern. Optionally, there may be a clean-up/teardown step after the assert. Syntax: . it(\"should check a specific behaviour\", () =&gt; {}); . Let us write a simple test for our add() method to check 1 + 1 = 2. We start by adding a spec to the suite we created previously. describe(\"services &gt; math\", () =&gt; { describe(\"Calculator\", () =&gt; { describe(\"add()\", () =&gt; { it(\"should return 2 when inputs are 1 and 1\", () =&gt; { // Assemble // Act // Assert }); }); }); }); .

To understand these differences, let us take a look at the example of Store.ts with the below code. export default class Store { private static _data: any = null; public static getData(): any { return Store._data; } public static setData(data: any): void { Store._data = data; } } . | Use .toEqual() to compare recursively all properties of object instances (also known as “deep” equality).

    "content": "Assemble . In order to run a test, we need to first assemble it. This may include creating instances of classes/variables, setting up test data for inputs, setting up spies/stubs/mocks (which will be covered in subsequest sections), or setting up the expected output. In simple cases, one may not need to assemble the test. This phase is very similar to the setup phase. In our example, let us create an instance of the Calculator class as part of assembling the test. import Calculator from \"./calculator\"; describe(\"services &gt; math\", () =&gt; { describe(\"Calculator\", () =&gt; { describe(\"add()\", () =&gt; { it(\"should return 2 when inputs are 1 and 1\", () =&gt; { const calculator: Calculator = new Calculator(); // Act // Assert }); }); }); }); . Act . In this step, we actually execute the function under test with required inputs and get the returned result (if any). In our example, we will invoke the add() method with inputs (1, 1) and get the result. import Calculator from \"./calculator\"; describe(\"services &gt; math\", () =&gt; { describe(\"Calculator\", () =&gt; { describe(\"add()\", () =&gt; { it(\"should return 2 when inputs are 1 and 1\", () =&gt; { const calculator: Calculator = new Calculator(); const result: number = calculator.add(1, 1); // Assert }); }); }); }); . Assert . Assertion is a statement that validates the behavior of our code by comparing the actual result against the expected results. There are many assertions provided by Jest, including some useful assertions we will use throughout our tests. Some of these assertions are listed below: . | expect(actual).toEqual(expected) // Expects both entities to have the same value. | expect(actual).toBe(expected) // Expects both entities to be the same. | expect(spy/stub/mock).toHaveBeenCalled() // Expects a function being spied/stubbed/mocked to be invoked. | expect(spy/stub/mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith([arguments]) // Expects a function being spied/stubbed/mocked to be invoked with specified arguments. | expect(actual).toBeDefined() // Expects the entity to be defined. | expect(actual).not. // Negates the assertion. Can be chained with any matchers above | await expect(error causing code returning a promise).rejects.toThrowError() // Waits for the error throwing code that returns promise (e.g. an API call) to throw the error and asserts the error was thrown. | . A full list of matchers can be found here. In our example, we can use the .toEqual() matcher. import Calculator from \"./calculator\"; describe(\"services &gt; math\", () =&gt; { describe(\"Calculator\", () =&gt; { describe(\"add()\", () =&gt; { it(\"should return 2 when inputs are 1 and 1\", () =&gt; { const calculator: Calculator = new Calculator(); const result: number = calculator.add(1, 1); expect(result).toEqual(2); }); }); }); }); .

    "content": "Often in tests, we need some things to happen before a test actually runs and some things to happen after it. This may include resetting/initializing values, setting up test data, setting up spies/stubs/mocks, cleaning up variables after a test, or resetting spies/stubs/mocks. Sometimes these steps may need to be repeated for each test. This is where the setup and teardown can be especially useful. Jest Provides 2 methods for setup and 2 methods for teardown: . | beforeAll(): Runs one time before all the tests in a suite. | beforeEach(): Runs before every test in a suite. | afterEach(): Runs after every test in a suite. | afterAll(): Runs once after all tests in a suite. | . In our example, notice we created an instance of calculator in our Assemble phase. We will probably have multiple tests for the calculator that will require this instance. In order to avoid repeating this in every step, let us move this to the setup phase and add a teardown to clear this after all tests. Note: Use beforeEach()/afterEach() if the function/class stores state, and we need a clean instance for each test. In our case, calculator does not store any state, and we can share the same instance across tests with out any side effects. Hence, we will use beforeAll()/afterAll(). import Calculator from \"./calculator\"; describe(\"services &gt; math\", () =&gt; { describe(\"Calculator\", () =&gt; { describe(\"add()\", () =&gt; { let calculator: Calculator; beforeAll(() =&gt; { calculator = new Calculator(); }); afterAll(() =&gt; { calculator = undefined; }); it(\"should return 2 when inputs are 1 and 1\", () =&gt; { const result: number = calculator.add(1, 1); expect(result).toEqual(2); }); }); }); }); .

    "content": "As a project grows so do the interdependencies in the project. A function under test can have dependencies from various external entities. This may include other functions, network requests, database connections, or built-in connections. Spies, Stubs, and Mocks are ways of dealing with such external dependencies. You can read more on what you can do with spies/stubs/mocks here. Spy . A spy is a watcher on a function that tracks various properties of the function being spied on. This can return information such as whether a function was invoked, how many times it was invoked, and what argument it was invoked with. A spy on a function is created using the syntax const spy = jest.spyOn(object, 'methodName'); . Note: The function being spied on actually executes. In our example, we have an external dependency on console.log(). Let us add a spy and test for it. import Calculator from \"./calculator\"; describe(\"services &gt; math\", () =&gt; { describe(\"Calculator\", () =&gt; { describe(\"add()\", () =&gt; { let calculator: Calculator; beforeAll(() =&gt; { calculator = new Calculator(); }); afterAll(() =&gt; { calculator = undefined; }); it(\"should invoke console.log() with the result 2 for inputs 1 and 1\", () =&gt; { const logSpy = jest.spyOn(window.console, \"log\"); const result: number = calculator.add(1, 1); expect(logSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\"The result is: \", result); logSpy.mockRestore(); }); }); }); }); . Mock . A mock is function which replaces an existing function. In our example, if we wanted to change the behavior of console.log() for our tests, we can do so using a mock. A mock implementation can be substituted for a spy or a jest.fn(). The syntax is as below: . spy.mockImplementation(() =&gt; { // new function body goes here. }); . Note: The function being mocked does not execute. In our example, if we wanted to replace the behavior of console.log(), we can do so as shown: . it(\"should invoke console.log() with the result 2 for inputs 1 and 1\", () =&gt; { const logSpy = jest.spyOn(window.console, \"log\"); logSpy.mockImplementation(() =&gt; { // This will no longer print to console. }); const result: number = calculator.add(1, 1); expect(logSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\"The result is: \", result); logSpy.mockRestore(); }); . Warning: Watch out for circular dependencies in mock implementations. Stub . A stub is a special kind of mock which does not require an alternate implementation but instead returns some value that we specify. When a stub gets invoked, it does not invoke the actual function, but returns the desired value instead. The syntax is as below: . spy.mockReturnValue(someValue); . To return a promise, we can use: . spy.mockResolvedValue(someValue); . This can be especially handy when stubbing Axios requests. Using a stub in our example simply prevents console.log() from being executed, since it does not return a value anyway. it(\"should invoke console.log() with the result 2 for inputs 1 and 1\", () =&gt; { const logSpy = jest.spyOn(window.console, \"log\"); logSpy.mockReturnValue(); const result: number = calculator.add(1, 1); expect(logSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\"The result is: \", result); logSpy.mockRestore(); }); .

    "doc": "Unit Testing with Jest",
    "title": "Testing Asynchronous Code",
    "content": "Promise . In previous tutorials, we have used Axios to make http requests which return promises. This is how we can write tests for axios requests. Consider the example below: . import axios from \"axios\"; import Store from \"../../utils/store/store\"; export default class HttpService { public getData(): Promise&lt;any&gt; { return axios.get(\"/myUrl\"); } } . We can test the above code as follows: . // Assuming we have done the setup as in previous tests describe(\"getData()\", () =&gt; { it('should invoke axios.get() with \"myUrl\"', async () =&gt; { const getStub = jest .spyOn(axios, \"get\") .mockResolvedValue({ status: 200, data: {} }); await httpService.getData(); expect(getStub).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\"/myUrl\"); }); it(\"should return the status as 200\", async () =&gt; { const getStub = jest .spyOn(axios, \"get\") .mockResolvedValue({ status: 200, data: {} }); const response = await httpService.getData(); expect(response.status).toEqual(200); getStub.mockRestore(); }); }); . Note: You can return different values for subsequent calls to a stub. Occasionally, you may run into situations where an http request is made but no promise is returned. This is often found in cases involving “fire and forget” calls or a central store with an Observable pattern implementation (e.g. Redux with react). We cannot await a function that does not return a promise. However, we can use fake timers to simulate passage of time to test such asynchronous behavior. Consider the example below: . import axios from \"axios\"; import Store from \"../../utils/store/store\"; export default class HttpService { public getData(): Promise&lt;any&gt; { return axios.get(\"/myUrl\"); } public getDataAndSetStore(): void { axios.get(\"/myUrl\").then((res) =&gt; { Store.setData(res.data); }); } } . We can test the above functionality as follows: . describe(\"getDataAndSetStore()\", () =&gt; { it('should invoke axios.get() with \"myUrl\"', async () =&gt; { const getStub = jest .spyOn(axios, \"get\") .mockResolvedValue({ status: 200, data: {} }); await httpService.getDataAndSetStore(); expect(getStub).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\"/myUrl\"); }); it(\"should set the data in store\", async () =&gt; { const addDataStub = jest.spyOn(Store, \"setData\").mockImplementation(); const getStub = jest .spyOn(axios, \"get\") .mockResolvedValue({ status: 200, data: \"myData\" }); jest.useFakeTimers(); httpService.getDataAndSetStore(); jest.runAllTimers(); await Promise.resolve(); expect(addDataStub).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\"myData\"); addDataStub.mockRestore(); getStub.mockRestore(); jest.useRealTimers(); }); }); . Callbacks . Callbacks are one of the most commonly used patterns for asynchronous programming in JavaScript/TypeScript. Consider the below callback function use case: . test('Check if I am a true husky', () =&gt; { function callback(data) { expect(data).toBe('I am from Northeastern!'); } fetchData(callback); }); . Here, fetchData() is a function that takes a callback and would call that callback function later in it’s implementation. Now consider 2 scenarios: . case 1: . fetchData(callback) { setTimeout(()=&gt;{ callback('I am from Northeastern!'); }, 1000); } . case 2: . fetchData(callback) { setTimeout(()=&gt;{ callback('I am not from Northeastern!'); }, 1000); } . The test case would still pass in either of the above scenarios since fetchData() is an async function, which means the program will not wait for the call to complete. The correct way to test a callback would be using the argument done in the test like shown in below example: . test('Check if I am a true husky', (done) =&gt; { function callback(data) { expect(data).toBe('I am from Northeastern!'); done(); } fetchData(callback); }); . Now, the program would wait for done to be invoked. This implementation would correctly test both the above scenarios. ",

    "title": "React Component",
    "content": "React follows a Component based architecture. A component is a repeatable html element with built-in state, business logic, and a lifecycle. The component may be something as simple as a single html element such as an input box, or a button, or a complex entity made up of other components. Components are the basic building blocks of a React application and they allow the developer to split the UI into independent and reusable pieces where each piece can be used in isolation. Creating A Function Component in React . view in sandbox . The simplest method to define a component is to write a function in Javascript. These components are also widely referred as functional stateless components but in the recent versions of React, they have the capabilities to contain state as well. import * as React from \"react\"; interface Props = {name?: string}; function App (props: Props) { return ( &lt;div className=\"App\"&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to React with Typescript Tutorial.&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); } export default App; . A Few Things to Note About React Components: . | The root (App) component is the entry point for the React App and all other components are nested in it. | We define a function component using a javascript function, passing the props type in as a generic parameter. | The import statement is used to import the public classes/functions from the react library. | A function can return a single top level element. | div is the top level element in this case and other elements can be nested in it. | The attribute className is used to specify a CSS class name if CSS properties have been defined seperately for a class. | className attribute is used to set the value of an element’s class attribute. Using this property, the user can set the class of an element to the desired class. | . | . | The round brackets (()) after return are used to span a JSX/TSX element across multiple lines. | At last , the component needs to be exported from the current file, so that it can be imported somewhere else and can be used either in isolation or combination with other components for rendering on the UI. | Elements on one line can be returned directly. | Each instance of a component creates a new element independent of other instances of the component. | Each component has it’s own state, props, and lifecycle (which will be explored later in the tutorial). | .

    "title": "Props",
    "content": "view in sandbox . React components are similar to JavaScript functions and can accept arbitrary arguments called props. Since components are reusable, props are especially useful to display different content in each instance of the component. Let us extract the header elements from the previous code snippet into a new component called Header. We can then use props to say “hello” to different users. | Create a new file in src/ directory called Header.tsx | Create and export a function called Header in the file as below: ```ts import React from “react”; | . interface IProps { name?: string; } . const Header = (props: IProps) =&gt; { return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;; }; . Header.defaultProps = { name: “World” }; . export default Header; . - The above code snippet creates a new function component `Header` and prints the value of the `name` passed in the props. - It defines a defaultProps for the component `Header` where the default value for `name` is used in case the value for props for `name` is not passed in any instance of the component. - In App.tsx: - Remove the code in h1 tags. - Import the Header component as below: - ```ts import Header from './Header'; ``` - Update the contents of return as below: - ```ts &lt;div className=\"App-header\"&gt; &lt;Header /&gt; &lt;Header name=\"John\" /&gt; &lt;Header name=\"Jane\" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ``` - Save all files and run npm start A few things to note from the above example: - Component.defaultProps can be used to specify default values for props. - Components are rendered to the user interface and the component’s logic contains the data to be displayed in the view(UI). - Curly braces ({}) in JSX/TSX are used as a connection between the data to be displayed in the view and the component’s logic for displaying the data in the view. - In our example, `{props.name}` will reflect the value of the property `name` in the view(html) for the cases when the values \"John\" and \"Jane\" are passed as props for the `name` property. - If no props are passed for an instance of the component, then it will display the default value of props. ## State State management is just a means of facilitating data sharing and communication among components. It creates a concrete data structure that you can read and write to reflect the state of your program. ```ts const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0) . The above snippet shows creation of counter state with an intial value of 0. Using the array destructuring syntax we extract out the state variable and the function to update the counter value. In its most basic form, a State object is a JavaScript object that represents the part of a component that can change as a result of a user’s action. States can also be thought of as a component’s memory. State update calls are asynchronous. As one cannot expect to call the update state function on one line and expect the state to be updated on the next. The reason for this is because update state methods are more of a request than an immediate order to update state. So React schedules an update to a component’s state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering. Also multiple update request may be batched into one for performance reasons. Changes in state and/or props will both cause our React component to re-render. Changes in state, on the other hand, can only occur internally as a result of components modifying their own state.  .

    "content": "Parent To Child Component Communication: . view in sandbox . Passing values from a parent component to a child component is simple. We only have to pass the values as props of the child component. The child component can then use the props object to output results. In the example code you will see that CounterContent component accepts a counter prop which is then used to display the value inside div element. import { useState } from \"react\"; interface CounterContentProps { counter: Number; } function CounterContent({ counter }: CounterContentProps) { return &lt;div&gt;Counter: {counter}&lt;/div&gt;; } function Counter() { const [counter, setCounter] = useState&lt;number&gt;(0); return ( &lt;&gt; &lt;CounterContent counter={counter} /&gt; &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCounter(counter + 1)}&gt;Increment Count&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/&gt; ); } . Child to Parent Component Communication . view in sandbox . For passing data from child component to parent component do the following steps: . | Declare a callback function inside the parent component.

For example, the HTML . &lt;button onclick=\"incrementCounter()\"&gt;Increment Counter&lt;/button&gt; . is slightly different in React: . &lt;button onclick=\"{incrementCounter}\"&gt;Increment Counter&lt;/button&gt; . | React provides an equivalent of each event that you might be familiar with from standard HTML DOM.

    "title": "React Hooks",
    "content": "React hooks are built-in functions which allows us to use state and other lifecycle features. The most basic hooks used by react are useState() which adds a state variable to a react component and useEffect() which is the lifecycle hook for a component. State of component referes to the data it is holding at a particular moment in time. useState(): . view in sandbox . In this section we will see how we can add state to a React Component using the useState() hook provided by React. The useState hook takes the initial value of the state variable as an argument, the initial state can be any type you want (a string, a number, an array, an object) or a function. Only on the first render will the initial value be assigned. Each useState call returns a two-element array. The state variable is the first element of the array, followed by a function to change the variable’s value. | We’ll start by defining and initializing state for the number of times the button is clicked, by adding the a state variable as follows: | . import {useState} from 'react'; function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); ... } . This line of code looks a little strange, so let’s break it down: . | When the hook useState() is invoked, it returns an array. Where the first item is the state value, and the second item is a function that updates the state. | First, we import the useState from react library. | useState is a React function that lets us create state, passing in a default value as a parameter. In our case, we pass it a default value of 0. | The useState function returns an array containing two elements: | . | The first array element contains the current value of state. | . | . | The second array element contains a function to set state to a different value. | . | We destructure the array and store the first array element (the state value) in count, and the second array element (the function to set state) in setCount. | The rest of the function now has access to the count, via the count variable. The function is also able to increment the count, via the setCount variable. | . | Let’s add a function to update the state of the variable: | . function incrementCount() { setCount(count + 1); } . | Now, functions to set the piece of state take in the new state as their parameter. | . | Next we’ll make the component return the count along with a button to increment the count when clicked. Final function code will be as follows: | . import { useState } from \"react\"; function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function incrementCount() { setCount(count + 1); } return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;button onClick={incrementCount}&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); } export default Counter; . If we give this a try in the running app, we should find the count variable’s value to keep incrementing by one every time the button is clicked. After we’ve got our heads around the code needed to define state, accessing and setting state is fairly simple and elegant. useEffect(): . view in sandbox . Now let’s have a look at how to invoke the code to execute at a certain point in the component’s lifecycle. Older versions of React consisted of different Lifecycle hooks that allowed a user to hook into various phases of component rendering such as componentDidMount, ComponentDidUpdate, etc. which have all been condensed into a single function called useEffect(). Let us observe how this hook behaves by printing out the count in browser console. | As always, we will start by importing the function from the react library: | . import { useEffect } from \"react\"; . | Next we will add the function to our existing counter component: | . useEffect(() =&gt; { console.log(`The current count is ${count}`); }, []); . Let’s break down this code to understand what is happening: . | We use React’s useEffect function to hook into the component life cycle. | The function takes in an arrow function, which executes when the component is first rendered. | The function takes in a second parameter, which determines when our arrow function is called. This parameter is an array of values that, when changed, will cause the arrow function to be invoked. In our case, we pass in an empty array, so our arrow function will never be called after the first render. | If we now try the running app and open the console, we’ll see Counter first rendering only appears once. | . | Let’s remove the second parameter into useEffect now: | . useEffect(() =&gt; { console.log(`The current count is ${count}`); }); . | Now we can see that the componenet will render everytime the value of count is changed. | Additionally we can also pass the variable in the array to observe only changes related to a particular value: | . useEffect(() =&gt; { console.log(`The current count is ${count}`); }, [count]); . | Finally, our component counter will look like: | . import { useState } from \"react\"; import { useEffect } from \"react\"; function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); function incrementCount() { setCount(count + 1); } useEffect(() =&gt; { console.log(`The current count is ${count}`); }); return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;button onClick={incrementCount}&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); } export default Counter; .
