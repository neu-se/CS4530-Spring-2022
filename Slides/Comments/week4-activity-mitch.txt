When I do npm install and open in VSC, I get a warning about "version
expansion limitied to 5000 lines.

package-lock.json is 13292 lines!

npm run-client gives some output that is vaguely like what's in the
readme, but different enough to give a student pause.

client.ts is mostly about how to construct REST calls, so importGrades
should probably live somewhere else.

importGrades should probably in a file other than client.ts
