# Project Overview
The assignments and project for this class are designed to mirror the experiences of a software engineer joining a new development team:
you will be "onboarded" to our codebase, make several individual contributions, and then form a team to propose, develop and implement a new feature.
The codebase that we'll be developing on is a remote collaboration tool called [Covey.Town](https://www.covey.town).
Covey.Town provides a virtual meeting space where different groups of people can have simultaneous video calls, allowing participants to drift between different conversations, just like in real life.
Covey.Town is inspired by existing products like [Gather.Town](https://gather.town), [Sococo](https://www.sococo.com), and [Gatherly.IO](https://www.gatherly.io) --- but it is an open source effort, and the features will be proposed and implemented by you!
All implementation will take place in the TypeScript programming language, using React for the user interface.



Select projects from Spring 2021 are hosted [in our project showcase](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/project-showcase).


### Overview of Project Deliverables

| Date | Deliverable | Description | 
| -----| ----------- | ----------- |
| 2/9/22 | [Team Formation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdf7hc6AZ80f9pwAOV7vPsJxpQ-0KWy_kkIABLkP761V4UPPw/viewform?usp=sf_link) | Specify preferences for teammates |
| 2/18/22 | Kickoff Team Meeting | Meet with your assigned TA mentor to discuss your project concept |
| 2/25/22 | Project Pitch | Propose a new feature for Covey.Town that can be implemented within 5 weeks |
| 3/11/22 | Project Plan | Refine the scope of your feature based on staff feedback, define detailed requirements and project acceptance criteria. Propose a high-level design. |
| 5/22/22 | Project Implementation and Documentation | Deliver your new feature, including design documentation and tests |

### Team Formation
All projects will be completed in a team of 4-5 students.
The very first deliverable for the project will be a team formation survey: you will be able to indicate
your preferences for teammates. The instructors will assign students to the teams based on a number of factors including your responses to the survey.
All students in each team must be in the same section of the class.

Complete the [team formation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdf7hc6AZ80f9pwAOV7vPsJxpQ-0KWy_kkIABLkP761V4UPPw/viewform?usp=sf_link) before Feb 9.

### Team Meetings with TA Mentor
Each team will be assigned a TA to act as a mentor, who will also serve as your point of contact for project grading.
During the week of February 14-18, you will have a "Kickoff Meeting" with your TA mentor, where you will meet your TA mentor and have the opportunity to share any early ideas that you might want feedback on before submitting the project pitch.
Once project begins in full force, you will have weekly meetings with your TA mentor (scheduled at your team's and the TA's convenience) in order to help ensure that you are making progress on the project, and to help address problems that you encounter (be they technical or non-technical problems).
### Project Pitch
All projects will involve frontend and backend development of a new feature for Covey.Town.
Once teams have been formed, you and your team will decide what kind of new feature you would like to build.
Your feature should be something that can be implemented within the timeframe allotted (5 weeks), and will be implemented in a fork of the main Covey.Town codebase.
Given that you will be up-to-speed on the Covey.Town codebase (and have been introduced to TypeScript, React, NodeJS, and testing frameworks),
and that you will have a team of four, we expect that the feature that you propose will be more complex than the feature implemented in the individual
homeworks.

The project pitch assignment will be released on February 11th.

### Project Plan
Based on the feedback that you receive from the course staff, you will propose a detailed plan to implement your new feature.
The project plan will include:
* Revised user stories and conditions of satisfaction (based on feedback on the project pitch)
* Revised design documents (based on feedback on the project pitch)
* Work breakdown: Map your user stories to engineering tasks. Assign each task to a team member (or pair of team members), provide an estimate for how long each task will take, a rationale for that estimate, and schedule those stories into 2 week sprints.

Your team will self-organize, as agile teams do and will use the work breakdown and schedule as the basis for weekly check-ins with your team's TA.

The project plan assignment will be released by February 18th.

### Project Implementation and Documentation
You will be assigned a mentor for your project who will work closely with you for the entire project. You will coordinate with the mentor to setup weekly meetings and regular sprint demos. Peer evaluation will also be used.
Your final team deliverable will be a "release" of your new feature on GitHub (with tests), and will be accompanied by a demo.
*Optionally,* you may also open a pull request to merge your feature into our main repository (submitting a pull request, or the pull request being merged into our
codebase is independent of the grade you receive, but provides a platform for more visiblity of your project). 

Your final team deliverable will include:
* The implementation of your new feature
* Automated tests for your new feature
* A README.md document that includes instructions to deploy Covey.Town with your new feature
* A FEATURE.md document that describes the final version of your use cases
* A DESIGN.md document that includes documentation of your design (using CRC cards, UML class diagrams, and/or UML sequence diagrams as you find necessary; remember that a picture is worth a thousand words!). In particular,
    for any change that you had to make to the existing codebase, provide a rationale for why the change was made, and what alternatives were considered.
* A revised work breakdown, updated to reflect the work that was actually done and by whom
* A 10 minute video that demonstrates the usage of your feature
    
Accompanying the final team deliverable will be an *individual reflection*, which every student must submit on their own, which will include your reflections on:
* The evolution of your project concept: How does the project that you delivered compare to what you originally planned to deliver? What caused these deviations?
* The software engineering processes that you feel could have been improved in your project: were there any procesess that in hindsight, you wish that you followed, or wish that you followed better?
* Your team dynamic: Provide a frank (and ideally, blameless) postmortem of your and your teammates collaborative performance and participation. If you had to do this same project over with the same teammates, what would *you* have done differently (or not) to improve your team's overall performance?

The complete grading breakdown for the project, and details for the final project deliverable will be released by March 4th.
